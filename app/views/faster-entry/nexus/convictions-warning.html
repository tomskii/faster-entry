      <p>You might still be able to apply for Nexus if you have a minor conviction that is more than 10 years old.</p>

      <p class="panel panel-border-wide">However, the Canadian and US authorities will consider all criminal offences, including spent ones, when making a Nexus application decision. This means if you have an older or spent conviction you still may not pass the UK background checks and won’t get a refund of the £42 fee.</p>
